## FAQ
- **IMDB website has pages for rankings of movies and series based on their ratings, what is the advantage of using your dashboards?**  
The rankings on the IMDB website are limited, for example you cannot limit the results to certain years, or set a threshold for the minimum number of votes (for the rating), etc.  
Also there is no ranking on IMDB website similar to our Episodes dashboard.
